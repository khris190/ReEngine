Every file of this type is nammed in fasion "animation_NameOfObject_NameOfAnimation.txt"

example:
"
< step = 0; stepMin = -75; stepMax = 75; speed = 10 >
	<model = 2; rot = -0.704; rotAround = -0.704;>
	<model = 3; rot = -0.384; rotAround = -0.384; posX = 0.448>

	<model = 4; rot = -0.704; rotAround = -0.704;>
	<model = 5; rot = -0.384; rotAround = -0.384; posX = 0.448>
<\>
"

first line contains base parametrs of animation;

"step" - initial step of animation
"stepMin" "stepMax" - range of step
"speed" - mostly not used (only in case of looped animations), how fast animation works


next you have some animationStep s
it has some special parametrs:
"stepMin" "stepMax" - currently does not work well, in which range of animation this animationStep works;
model - onto which model this animationStep afects

rest parametrs are taken from model file (without special once)
the values are added to model each step (randomisation works, but only once at loading the animation)
