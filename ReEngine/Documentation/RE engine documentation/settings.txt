there is one file of this type per game

it is so simple, just set some parametrs

"resolutionX" "resolutionY" - how big is the game window
"framerateLimit" how many frames per secound can be maximal
"fulScrean" - 0 to windowed, 1 to fullScrean view

"mouseSensitivity" - i hope i don't have to describe it
