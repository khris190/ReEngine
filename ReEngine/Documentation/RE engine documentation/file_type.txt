Every file in the game engine is builded in the same set of rules.

Basically if something is outside < ... > is ignored. You can use that to write comments to block some parts (if there was no "<" character ">" is ignored )

inside you can set some of parametrs, it depends on type of file you want to edit (check another documentation file to see more informations)

it works like that: nameOfParametr =value; 
nameOfParametr is always without white characters ( like space, enter, tabulation ect. )

worth to note is that strings ( names, paths ect) are loaded from sign = to ; including all spaces so best idea is to write something like that " path=Terrain\\object.png; "

/// multi line 

if you edit object like model, tecture list ect there is something more.

< basicParam1 =fsdfs; basicParam2 =fsdfsdf; ... >
	<childObjectParams =fsdfsd; ... >
	<childObjectParams =fsdfsd; ... >
	<childObjectParams =fsdfsd; ... >
	...
<\>

at most cases first <> contains basic params of object
then you have some child objects
and at the end of list "<\>". Worth to note is that it should be exacly <\> or game will stop working (endless loading, if it happends use task manager to close the game)

Now go to other files which will be describing how specific types of files works.
