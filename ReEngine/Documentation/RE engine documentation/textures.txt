Every file of this type is nammed in a way 
"texture_NameOfState.txt"

First lets take a look at example of texture file
< path =Graphics\\>
	// shiveil
	< path =shiveil\\headDk--.png>		1
	< path =shiveil\\shieldDk.png>		2
	< path =shiveil\\armDk.png>		3
	< path =shiveil\\arm2Dk.png>		4
	< path =shiveil\\weaponDk.png>		5
<\>

at first line path parametr describes somewhat prepath.
That means this string is added to every path of texture you are trying to add

next you have some textures to add. Every texture has his own index. So worth is to write it before/ afrer (like those 1,2,3 above).
Texture with index 0 is an empty texture
